ASC8.COM is a program whose binary content is made completely of displayable
ASCII characters.  It is a functioning program that does absolutely nothing.
The program uses self modifying code which breaks the execution pipe
contraints of older x86s.  In fact it requires a Pentium to run.  The author
is me (Paul Hsieh.)
