# Dumb_16bit_dos_utils

Collection of dumb 80286/80386 assembly command-line utils that I dribbled out for whatever reasons, a hundred years ago.
No idea what most of them do anymore. Some were experiments. Most were ascii converters to change from <input-file> to <output-file>.

They are now garbage, rubbish, junk. I just didn't want to loose them through time, like most source code from 30 years ago.
Most will work up until under x86 32-bit Windows XP command line.
All were assembled with Borland Turbo Assembler v4.0
